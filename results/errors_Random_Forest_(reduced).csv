FN,6569,1,0,0.5,"Oscar-winning actress Sandra Bullock is set to play Wendy Davis, or more commonly known to conservatives as,  Abortion Barbie . When radical feminist Wendy Davis decided to make her gubenatorial campaign about killing babies, conservatives wasted no time outing her, and her radical agenda for the state of Texas. While attending a fundraiser in Los Angeles during her campaign for governor in the state of Texas, Davis was greeted by life size  Abortion Barbie  posters created by conservative artist  Sabo .The Texas Democratic state senator who became a progressive darling after filibustering an abortion bill in 2013.Davis donned pink running shoes and filibustered for more than 11 hours on June 25, 2013, successfully blocking Senate Bill 5. The bill, among other measures, banned abortion after 20 weeks. WFBDavis got the unflattering nickname during her infamous filibuster. Thanks to conservative writer and Red State editor Erick Erickson, Davis will forever be known as  Abortion Barbie.  The moniker is a bit insulting but apropos given her steadfast defense of abortion on demand.Davis lost the race to the very popular conservative candidate, Republican Governor Greg Abott in a landslide.According to Variety, Sandra Bullock will star in the spec  Let Her Speak  as Texas senator Wendy Davis, whose 11-hour filibuster helped stall an anti-abortion bill in the Texas state house.Todd Black and Jason Blumenthal are on board to produce through their Escape Artists banner.

FN,12114,1,0,0.5,"The Justice Department on Thursday dropped the legal challenge to the the Washington Redskins  name, the Associated Press reported.According to the AP, the Trump administration dropped the challenge in a letter to the Supreme Court in response to last week s ruling in Matal V. Tam, in which an Asian-American rock band won the right to copyright the name  The Slants,  despite the name s offensive connotation.In the Thursday letter, the Justice Department argues that the Matal V. Tam decision means that the court would decide in favor of the Washington Redskins if the case went before the justices.Last week, Redskins owner Dan Snyder drew the same conclusion, and said he was  thrilled  by the court s decision in the copyright case His lawyer, Lisa Blatt, issued a  statement saying that the court s decision resolved the dispute over the NFL team s name.Washington Post  Nine in 10 Native Americans say they are not offended by the Washington Redskins name, according to a new Washington Post poll that shows how few ordinary Indians have been persuaded by a national movement to change the football team s moniker.Among the Native Americans reached over a five-month period ending in April, more than 7 in 10 said they did not feel the word  Redskin  was disrespectful to Indians. An even higher number   8 in 10   said they would not be offended if a non-native called them that name. The Washington Redskins team, our fans and community have always believed our name represents honor, respect and pride,  the owner said in a statement.  Today s Washington Post polling shows Native Americans agree. We are gratified by this overwhelming support from the Native American community, and the team will proudly carry the Redskins name. Watch: Snyder and his wife have a close relationship with President Trump and his administration. In January, Snyder attended an exclusive inauguration celebration with Trump s Cabinet members, and Snyder s wife donated to Trump s campaign in 2015.Weeks after Snyder s wife made the donation, Trump spoke out about the team name controversy, suggesting it should remain the Redskins. I know Indians that are extremely proud of that name,  Trump said in October of 2015. Honestly, I don t think they should change the name, unless the owner wanted to.  The Hill "
